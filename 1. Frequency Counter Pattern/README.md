## General Approach to the Frequency Pattern

### 1. Initialize a Storage Structure

Begin by setting up a data structure that maps each unique item to its frequency count. In most programming languages, this is usually done with a hash map or dictionary.

### 2. Process the Dataset

Iterate over your dataset, and for each item, update its count in your storage structure. If the item is not yet in the structure, add it with a count of 1. If it already exists, increment the existing count.

### 3. Use the Frequency Data

Once all items have been processed and their frequencies recorded, you can use this data for further analysis or operations. Common uses include sorting items by frequency, identifying the most or least frequent items, or applying algorithms that depend on the frequency of elements.
